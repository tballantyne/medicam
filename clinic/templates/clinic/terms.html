        <div>Provision of the Services by DOC19.</div>
        <ul>
          <li>10.1 DOC19 has business associates and affiliated legal entities around the world ("Affiliates"). Sometimes, these Affiliates will be providing the Services to you on behalf of DOC19 itself. You acknowledge and agree that Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.</li>
          <li>10.2 DOC19 is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which DOC19 provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.</li>
          <li>10.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that DOC19 may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at DOC19's sole discretion, without prior notice (excluding provisions provided through separate written agreement). Private individuals may stop using the Services at any time, and do not need to specifically inform DOC19 when you stop using the Services. Entities or organizations must abide by the terms of their respective contracts.</li>
          <li>10.4 You acknowledge and agree that if DOC19 disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.</li>
          <li>10.5 You acknowledge and agree that while DOC19 may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by DOC19 at any time, at DOC19' discretion.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Content and Services Accessed through DOC19.</div>
        <p>DOC19 may include content that you find offensive, including health-related content that is sexually explicit.</p>
        <p>DOC19 may screen, modify, refuse, or remove certain content or third-party services, but is not responsible for and does not endorse any third-party content or services. DOC19 further does not endorse any third-party service providers, other health care providers, products, services, opinions, or web sites accessed through DOC19. Use of these services and reliance on this content is solely at your own risk. DOC19 may not be held liable for any damages arising out of or related to your use of any third-party service or content.</p>
      </li>
      <li><span>DOC19 Proprietary Rights.</span> <span>DOC19 and its Affiliates own all proprietary rights to DOC19. DOC19 gives you a personal, revocable, non-assignable, and non-exclusive license to use DOC19.</span></li>
      <li><span>Changes to this Agreement. </span> <span>DOC19 may change this agreement and will post the modified agreement. If you do not agree to the modified agreement, you should stop using DOC19. Your continued use of DOC19 after the date the modified agreement is posted will constitute your acceptance of the modified agreement.</span></li>
      <li><span>Indemnification.</span> <span>Upon a request by us, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our employees, contractors, officers, directors, agents, parent, other affiliated companies, and suppliers, from all liabilities, claims, demands and expenses, including attorney's fees, made by any third party that arise from or are related to (a) your access to the Site, (b) your use of the Services, or (c) the violation of these Terms of Use by you or any third party using your Credentials of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. The foregoing indemnification obligation does not apply to liabilities, claims and expenses arising as a result of our own gross negligence or intentional misconduct.</span></li>
      <li><span>Exclusion of Warranties. </span> <span>We provide the site and the services "as is", "with all faults" and "as available." We make no express or implied warranties or guarantees about the services. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we hereby disclaim all such warranties, including all statutory warranties, with respect to the services and the site, including without limitation any warranties that the services are merchantable, of satisfactory quality, accurate, fit for a particular purpose or need, or non-infringing. We do not guarantee that the results that may be obtained from the use of the services will be effective, reliable, or accurate or will meet your requirements. We do not guarantee that you will be able to access or use the services (either directly or through third-party networks) at times or locations of your choosing. We are not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, timeliness or completeness of information provided by users of the site or any other data or information provided or received through the site. Except as expressly set forth herein, DOC19 makes no warranties about the information systems, software and functions made accessible through the site or any other security associated with the transmission of sensitive information. DOC19 does not warrant that the site or the services will operate error-free, that loss of data will not occur, or that the services, software, or site are free of computer viruses, contaminants or other harmful items. Content in DOC19 is developed for use in the United States, and neither DOC19 nor any of DOC19' Affiliates make any representation concerning the content when used in any other country.</span></li>
      <li><span>Limitation of Liability.</span> <span>You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that DOC19 has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under these Terms, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which DOC19 or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.<br>Your sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute with us is the cancellation of your registration. In no event shall our total cumulative liability to you for any and all claims relating to or arising out of your use of the services or the site, regardless of the form of action, exceed the greater of (a): the total amount of fees, if any, that you paid to utilize the site or the services or (B) $100. In no event shall we be liable to you (or to any third party claiming under or through you) for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages arising from your use of, or inability to use, the site and/or the services. These exclusions apply to any claims for lost profits, lost data, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, any other commercial damages or losses, or medical malpractice or negligence of physicians utilized through use of the service, even if we knew or should have known the possibility of such damages. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the extent permitted by law. If you are a California resident, you waive your rights with respect to California Civil Code Section 1542, which says "a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."<br>The limitations of liability in this Section do not apply to breaches of intellectual property provisions or indemnification obligations.</span></li>
      <li>
        <p><span>General Legal Terms.</span> <span>These Terms of Use and any supplemental terms, policies, rules and guidelines posted on the Site, including the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us, if you have not signed a separate written agreement with DOC19 related to DOC19. If there is any conflict between this agreement and a signed written agreement between you and DOC19 related to DOC19, the signed written agreement will control.</span></p>
        <p>If any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of DOC19 to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.</p>
        <p>If DOC19 provides you with a translation of the English language version of this agreement, the English language version of this agreement will control if there is any conflict.</p>
        <p>This agreement is governed by Delaware law, excluding California's choice-of-law rules. These Terms of Use shall be deemed to have been entered into and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware as applied to contracts made and to be performed entirely within Delaware, without giving effect to the state’s conflicts of law statute. Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or related to these Terms of Use or your use of the Services shall be settled by final and binding arbitration to be conducted by an arbitration tribunal in Delaware, pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR ANY DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS DELAWARE. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction; (d) the arbitration tribunal shall consist of one arbitrator; (e) the decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final, and (f) judgment upon such decision or award may be entered in any competent court or application may be made to any competent court for judicial acceptance of such decision or award and an order of enforcement. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to impose equitable and injunctive relief as well as to award monetary relief, as the arbitrator deems appropriate.</p>
        <p>Nothing in this agreement limits either party's ability to seek equitable relief.</p>
